Over the years, I’ve built dashboards for enterprises, small businesses, and sports teams. While dashboards initially spark excitement—promising a modern, data-driven approach—the story often ends the same way. Whether it’s a global company or a hockey team, most dashboards fail to deliver results. Instead of solving real problems, they often serve as a way to appear “cutting-edge” without making a real impact.

## Why Dashboards Fail

### 1. Too Many Metrics
Dashboards often bombard users with excessive data, making it hard to identify what matters.

- **Example in Enterprise**: A company’s sales dashboard tracked dozens of KPIs, from lead response times to customer churn rates. Teams couldn’t focus, so the dashboard was ignored.
- **Example in Small Business**: A retail store tried to track inventory, revenue, customer feedback, and marketing campaigns in one dashboard. It became too complicated to use.
- **Example in Sports**: A hockey team monitored 30+ stats, including puck possession and blocked shots. Coaches didn’t know where to focus and stopped using it.
- **Research Insight**: Gartner reports that 60% of analytics projects fail due to data overload and the lack of actionable insights.

### 2. No Clear Purpose
Many dashboards look impressive but fail to solve real-world problems.

- **Example in Enterprise**: A supply chain dashboard showed global shipping metrics but didn’t address delays at specific ports.
- **Example in Small Business**: A marketing dashboard tracked ad impressions but didn’t tie them to actual sales.
- **Example in Sports**: A team tracked player stats but didn’t analyze why they consistently lost in the third period.
- **Expert Advice**: McKinsey stresses that dashboards must align with specific goals to create value.

### 3. Lack of Actionable Insights
Dashboards often show what’s happening but fail to recommend what to do next.

- **Example in Enterprise**: A dashboard highlighted increasing employee turnover but didn’t suggest interventions, like revising benefits.
- **Example in Small Business**: A restaurant noticed declining reviews but didn’t provide insights on specific complaints, like long wait times.
- **Example in Sports**: A team saw their power play success rate declining but didn’t implement targeted drills, and the problem persisted.
- **Expert Insight**: Harvard Business Review highlights that analytics tools often fail because they don’t drive actionable decisions.

## A Better Approach

### 1. Focus on Solving Real Problems
- **Enterprise Example**: Instead of tracking general HR metrics, one company focused on reducing recruitment time in key regions.
- **Small Business Example**: A café used a dashboard to analyze peak hours and optimized staffing schedules accordingly.
- **Sports Example**: A hockey team analyzed why they lost close games in overtime, focusing their dashboard on fatigue and defensive breakdowns.

### 2. Highlight Only Key Metrics
- **Enterprise Example**: A sales team focused on lead conversion rates and sales cycle length rather than tracking dozens of metrics.
- **Small Business Example**: A retail store focused on inventory turnover and top-selling products instead of tracking every SKU.
- **Sports Example**: A team simplified their dashboard to two KPIs: scoring chances and time in the offensive zone. This focus helped them adjust their attack strategy, increasing goals per game by 10%.

### 3. Drive Actionable Change
- **Enterprise Example**: A manufacturing company used dashboards to pinpoint machine downtime, leading to targeted maintenance schedules.
- **Small Business Example**: A restaurant analyzed customer complaints and introduced staff training to address common issues.
- **Sports Example**: A team noticed poor third-period endurance and implemented conditioning drills, resulting in fewer late-game losses.

## The Takeaway

Dashboards often fail because they try to do too much or are created just for appearances—a phenomenon sometimes referred to as “data theater.” The most successful dashboards:
- Solve specific problems.
- Focus on the most critical metrics.
- Drive actionable decisions.

Whether you’re in an enterprise, small business, or sports team, ask yourself: Are your dashboards solving problems, or are they just for show? If it’s the latter, it’s time to rethink your approach.
