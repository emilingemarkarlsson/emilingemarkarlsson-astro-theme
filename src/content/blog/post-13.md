Steps to test digital prototypes without investing too much time or effort:

1. **Understand Your Objective**:
    - Clearly define what you want to test. Is it usability, specific features, or user flows?
    - Keep your focus narrow to avoid overwhelming yourself.
2. **Create a Simple Design**:
    - Make a basic mock-up or prototype. It doesn’t need to be perfect; just capture the core functionality.
    - Use wireframing tools or even pen and paper.
3. **Prioritize What to Test**:
    - Identify the riskiest assumptions or critical elements. What needs validation?
    - Avoid testing everything at once.
4. **Set Up Scenarios**:
    - Create scenarios that mimic real-world usage. For instance, simulate adding a connection in a social app.
    - Keep scenarios short and relevant.
5. **Get Feedback**:
    - Share your prototype with potential users, colleagues, or friends.
    - Ask open-ended questions: “How would you use this feature?” or “What challenges do you see?”
6. **Apply “The Mom Test”**:
    - Talk about their experiences, not your idea. Ask about past behavior.
    - Dig deeper by asking specifics: “Have you looked for a similar solution before?”

Remember that rapid prototyping allows you to discover if your product is worth building and refine your concept efficiently. By involving cross-functional teams and documenting the process, you can continuously improve your prototype and create research-informed products.
